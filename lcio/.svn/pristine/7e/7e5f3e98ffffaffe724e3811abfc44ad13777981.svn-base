#  lciohbook:
#  A simple script is provided that creates and runs lciohbook_F.
#  lciohbook_F opens the LCIO file test.slcio and creates
#  an hbook file lcio.hbook with a few histograms 
#  for MCParticles using the the fortran interface.
#  Finally the cernlib's "paw" is called which presents
#  the histograms.
