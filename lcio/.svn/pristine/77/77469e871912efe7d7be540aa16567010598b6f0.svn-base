*  LCIOAnalysis.java:   an LCIO/AIDA example
*
*********************************************************


Example code that reads an LCIO file and creates an AIDA compliant outputfile
with some histograms.

It requires LCIO and an AIDA implementation installed on your system.

The following environment variables have to be defined:  LCIO, AIDA, e.g.:

 export LCIO=~/lcio/devel/v00-09beta
 export AIDA=/data/gaede/JAIDA-3.2.0

This uses the default Java implementation of AIDA from
   http://java.freehep.org/jaida/index.html


You can also use JAS3 to create (and analyze) the AIDA file, see
   http://jas.freehep.org/jas3/index.html

For more information on analysing LCIO files with JAS3 please see:
   http://jas.freehep.org/jas3/plugins/lcio/1.0/docs/index.html

To build the example under linux use

 ./build.sh

and to run it:

 ./runAnalysis.sh test.slcio

this will create lcio2.aida from the MCParticles in test.slcio.


For other OS use equivalent scripts to set the classpath accordingly.
