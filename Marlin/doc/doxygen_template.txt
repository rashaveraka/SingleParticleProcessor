/** Short description of processor - the first sentence, i.\ e.\ everything to the first 
 *  '.' not followed by a '\'. 
 * 
 *  Here we should have a full description of the processor, i.e. describing the purpose and 
 *  the algorithm  and all the details needed to run this processor in a meaning full way.
 *  It should be written so that also non-experts can use this class in their programs. 
 *  
 *  <h4>Input collections and prerequisites</h4>
 *  Summarize what (mandatory?) input collections are needed or other prerequisites, e.g. a particular 
 *  processor that has to be run before this one -  which typically should be avoided in order to keep 
 *  MarlinReco modular.
 *
 *  <h4>Output</h4> 
 *  Output colection(s) of the processor and/or other output like histograms. 
 *  
 *  List all steering file parameters with the <em>\@param</em> tag:
 * 
 * @param CollectionName Name of the MCParticle collection
 * @param EnergyCut energy cut for MC particles
 *
