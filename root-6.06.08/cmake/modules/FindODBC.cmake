# Find the ODBC driver manager includes and library.
#
# ODBC is an open standard for connecting to different databases in a
# semi-vendor-independent fashion.  First you install the ODBC driver
# manager.  Then you need a driver for each separate database you want
# to connect to (unless a generic one works).  VTK includes neither
# the driver manager nor the vendor-specific drivers: you have to find
# those yourself.
#
# This module defines
# ODBC_INCLUDE_DIR where to find sql.h
# ODBC_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use ODBC
# ODBC_FOUND.  If false, you cannot build anything that requires MySQL.
# also defined, but not for general use is
# ODBC_LIBRARY, where to find the ODBC driver manager library.

#---For the windows platform ODBC is located automatically
